# Nested Routing for Modals

I've done this project to resolve a problem in the lablabee help center,

The help center contains question in cards or lists, to see the full question answer the user should click on the question item to display a popup.

When a user reaches to our support the support assistante needed to send to the user a link that opens the popup containing the answer to his question.

So in this project I've made a nested route that bring the user directly to the question popup using a direct link.

Nb: the data is not accurate with the project reauirement but the functionalities are.
